From Dan Brown's Digital Fortress


With Merlutti’s napkins and concert programs as herchalkboard, Susan set out to give her charming new pedagogue aminicourse in cryptography. She began with Julius Caesar’s“perfect square” cipher box.
Caesar, she explained, was the first code-writer in history.When his foot-messengers started getting ambushed and his secretcommuniqués stolen, he devised a rudimentary way to encrypthis directives. He rearranged the text of his messages such thatthe correspondence looked senseless. Of course, it was not. Eachmessage always had a letter-count that was a perfectsquare—sixteen, twenty-five, one hundred—depending on howmuch Caesar needed to say. He secretly informed his officers thatwhen a random message arrived, they should transcribe the text intoa square grid. If they did, and read topto-bottom, a secretmessage would magically appear. Over time Caesar’s concept of rearranging text was adoptedby others and modified to become more difficult to break. Thepinnacle of noncomputer-based encryption came during World War II.The Nazis built a baffling encryption machine named Enigma. Thedevice resembled an old-fashioned typewriter with brassinterlocking rotos that revolved in intricate ways and shuffledcleartext into confounding arrays of seemingly senseless charactergroupings. Only by having another Enigma machine, calibrated theexact same way, could the recipient break the code. Becker listened, spellbound. The teacher had become thestudent.
